# cs441_GameProject
Using Xcode and SpriteKit to make a basic game with animations.

This endless scrolling game uses various tools in SpriteKit to handle animations and physics. The player controls the man on the bike and the goal of the game is to see how long you can last without getting hit by the bugs. Two different types of bugs will randomly spawn, a high bug or a low bug. The high bug is able to be avoided by simply driving under it. The low bug must be avoided by jumping over it (the player must tap the screen to make the biker jump). Upon collision with a bug, the bug will despawn, the biker will reset back at the starting position, and the score will be reset to 0. See how far you can get!

Commit History:

10/6: Got objects to move across the screen

10/7: Got the characted to be able to jump when the screen is tapped.

10/11: Continued working on game code

10/13-10/14: Added score tracking and collision physics. Whenever a bug passes the biker, you get a point. If you hit a bug, your score resets.
